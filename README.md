# üåê Subgraphs

Subgraphs for Nation3 smart contracts

## Deployed Subgraphs

### üõÇ [Passport Issuance](./passportissuance/)

This subgraph tracks the following events from the Nation3 [`PassportIssuer`](https://github.com/nation3/foundations/blob/main/src/passport/PassportIssuer.sol) contract:

`event Attest(address indexed _to, uint256 indexed _tokenId);`

Tracks Passport issuance. Initiated by [`claim(uint8, bytes32, bytes32)`](https://github.com/nation3/foundations/blob/main/src/passport/PassportIssuer.sol#L131)

`event Revoke(address indexed _to, uint256 indexed _tokenId);`

Tracks Passport revocations. Initiated by [`revoke(address)`](https://github.com/nation3/foundations/blob/main/src/passport/PassportIssuer.sol#L150).

`event UpdateRequirements(uint256 claimRequiredBalance, uint256 revokeUnderBalance);`

Tracks changes to Passport issuance params. Initiated by [`setParams(uint256, uin256)`](https://github.com/nation3/foundations/blob/main/src/passport/PassportIssuer.sol#L162)

Refer to the following guide from [The Graph's docs](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/querying/querying-the-graph/) on how to execute a query remotely.

## Contributing

Refer to [this document from The Graph's docs](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/creating-a-subgraph/) on how to set up your development environment for making changes to, and deploying new, subgraphs.

## Testing

Two options are available for testing:

1. [Local Graph deployment (integration testing)](/#Local)
2. [Matchstick unit tests](/#Matchstick)

### Local

To test your changes to the subgraph locally you will need a local IPFS Gateway for the subgraph to deploy files to.

Refer to [this guide](https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/command-line-quick-start/) to learn how to do so and ensure your gateway points to `http://localhost:5001`.

Then run the following commands in the subgraph's directory (e.g. the [PassportIssuer](./passportissuance/) subgraph directory):

```console
npm run codegen
npm run build
npm run create-local
npm run deploy-local
```

### [Matchstick](https://github.com/LimeChain/matchstick/blob/main/README.md)

Simply run the following command to run the available tests in their respective subgraph directories (e.g. [PassportIssuer](./passportissuance/)):

```console
npm run test
```
